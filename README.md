# Speech-Recognition-System

Developed my version of speech recognition software in python by using the concepts of Machine Learning.
Implemented Feed Forward Network with 3 Layers and used Back Propagation to update the weights and biases.
MFCC (feature vector for the audio signals) was used as the input for our articial neural network.
